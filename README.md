# ARDPIC
Arduino como programador de PIC 16F877A

### SUMMARY
ARDPIC is a programmer LVP (Low Voltage Programming), based on an ARDUINO board


### Features
- interface to controlling the programmer
- .hex file selector
- Support for PIC 16f877a
- Development the version 2

### HOW TO USE

- step 1:
Download the .zip file, you will find inside two files, the .ino file must be loaded on any arduino board, the second file, is the ARDPIC GUI, it is an .exe file, just run it. 

- step 2: 
Now you have to connect the arduino board to the PIC, to do this, follow the  image bellow, if you need some information, you can read the PIC documentation in the next link. [PIC16F877A](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/39582b.pdf "PIC16F877A")
